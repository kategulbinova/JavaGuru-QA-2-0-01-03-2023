				<td colspan = 1, rowspan = 4>The term comes from the Italian <b>caffellatte</b> or <b>caffè latte</b>, from caffè e latte, literally "coffee and milk".<br>If you ask an Italian "Can I have a latte, per favore" - you are going to get a glass of milk! Be careful what you ask for.<br>A latte is a milk coffee that boasts a silky layer of foam as a real highlight to the drink. A true latte will be made up of one or two shots of espresso, steamed milk and a final, thin layer of frothed milk on top. These elements combined result in a balanced milky coffee that possesses an aesthetically pleasing look and a smooth texture.<br>And if you want to spice up your latte, add some flavouring syrup.</td>
